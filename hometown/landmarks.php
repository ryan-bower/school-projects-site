      <h1>Historical Landmarks</h1>
      <p class="info-sum">
        Perkasie has several historical landmarks throughout the city. Some the
        citizens are very proud of, and a few cause shame on our community. Here
        is a comprehensive list of these defining attractions in our area.

        <h2>Covered Bridge</h2>
        <p>
          The covered bridge (pictured right) was one of the first two bridges
          built in the area. It was constructed in 1832, and later decommissioned
          in 1958 due to its lack of structural integrity. Now it sits in Lenape
          Park uselessly allowing park-goers to pass over a 30 foot patch of grass.
          The bridge is maintained by the Perkasie Historical Society, which is a
          small motivated team of two committed residents.

        <h2>Perkasie Carousel</h2>
        <p>
          The Carousel was originally made of hand-carved wooden horses from 1891,
          but these were replace in 1951 with “much better” ones with “less
          splinters” and used “non-lead based paint”. The roof later collapsed in
          1995 due to heavy snowfall and an angry God, leading to a huge
          restoration project. Though no one has ever taken advantage of it, there
          is a party package for the carousel. It includes 1 hour of riding, a
          hotdog, chips, a drink, ice-cream, a free Carousel T-shirt, and 4-Tickets
          for a future date. It is charged per person, and costs $10 and an hour
          of your life that you can’t get back.

        <h2>Bucks County Public Library</h2>
        <p>
          Following the widespread use of smartphones in 2011, the public library
          has become a historic spot where community members would once go to
          “check out” physical copies of books. Ever since you could get virtually
          every book ever on one device, this building is now used for the
          gathering of ghosts. It is still technically open and operated by those
          known as “librarians” but is rarely visited, other than ironically or by
          hipsters. Often at the same time.

        <h2>Pekasie Museum</h2>
        <p>
          The Perkasie Museum holds some of the most interesting pieces from the
          local area. Though that is not saying very much, these relics of the
          town’s history mean a lot to a handful of people. You can see many
          different items on display there such as a World War I scrapbook, a list
          of various community recognitions for Perkasie soldiers, and large wheel
          that rolled into town one day. Nobody knows where it came from.
