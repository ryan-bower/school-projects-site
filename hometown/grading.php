        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
          I kept the target audience in mind, which in my mind is potential
          buyers of homes in Perkasie, as well as Residents with ages ranging
          from 30 years old to 70+ years. This is why I focused on high contrast
          colors, a very simple navigation, and an easy to understand home page.
          I chunked the information based on the place or topic I was talking
          about for that particular page.

        <h2>Code</h2>
        <p>
          I used a single separate style sheet for all of my CSS styling, and
          used server side includes for any repeated code. I kept the html layout
          generic enough to be very reusable across pages. I used plenty of
          comments to make it very clear what the different CSS selectors were
          used for, and descriptive tags so that the HTML is readable. All of my
          code validates, and is written as cleanly and simply as I could right it.

        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
          I have met the requirements for pages of content. All of the content
          was written in my own words, and reflects my knowledge and view of the
          town. I also included this grading page, as well as a references page
          to show that I met all of the requirements and to show where I got the
          images from that I used on the site.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a home page that links to all of the other pages on the site
          with pictures showing a bit of what that page is about. There is a
          second page about the Perk restaurant to give information about the
          most popular place to eat in Perkasie. There is a third page on the
          Menlo Pool, including all of the features and rules there. The fourth
          page is about Lenape Park, a popular picnic and hiking spot in Perkasie.
          A fifth page gives information about the largest Christian church in
          the area, as well as hours of operation. Page six is about the local
          dog park and the rules involved with bringing your dog to it. The
          seventh page tells what different elementary and middle schools are in
          the area, as well as information about Pennridge High School. The
          eighth page tells of the major historical events in the town, and the
          ninth page explains major landmarks in Perkasie. The final page is a
          map of the entire area, with a legend showing where many of the places
          from the site are in relation to each other.
