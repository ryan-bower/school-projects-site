      <h1>Lenape Park</h1>
      <p class="info-sum">
        The go-to picnic spot for all awkward teen couples is Lenape Park, nestled
        on Walnut Street and stretching over the Perkiomen Creek. This place has
        it all: Major League baseball fields, two suspension bridges, a skate park,
        several hobos that won’t go away, trained pigeons, a bush that looks like
        Ghandi, canoes that are much too small for people, and several pavilions
        for outdoor events.

        <h2>Hiking Trails</h2>
        <p>
          If you love walking outdoors and you’re not afraid of some
          semi-aggressive hobos, check out the trail map
          <a href="assets/downloads/trailmap.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.
          The trail map also shows the layout of the park, and where the other
          features are in relation to each other. There are biking and walking
          trails that wind throughout the park, allowing you see it all while
          getting some exercise. You can likely get away with using and electric
          skateboard or scooter, but that sort of defeats the purpose of going
          outside in the first place. Make sure to stop by the drinking fountain
          and stay hydrated! Or bring your own plastic water bottle and throw it
          in the Perkiomen Creek like the degenerate you are.

        <h2>Field and Pavilion Rentals</h2>
        <p>
          The park features several ball-game pitch ‘em up fields for all of your
          sport game athletic needs. The softball fields are $30 per team for the
          season, plus $15 per game for lights if it’s needed. Play in the dark
          with glow sticks is encouraged, but unsafe. A copy of your teams
          insurance must be included. Pavilion Rentals are $25 for 3 hours with a
          $25 deposit. The deposit was recently invoked when a party of carpenters
          scrapped the picnic tables for wood. Rental dates are on a first come,
          first serve, first pay, let the best man win basis. For more information
          contact the borough at (215)257-5065 or parkandrec@perkasieborough.org
          or by carrier pigeon.

        <h2>Skate Park</h2>
        <p>
          Grab your skateboard, your darkest pair of skinny jeans, that cool shirt
          with a skull on it, a ton of bracelets that say things like “Save the
          boobies”, a beanie that hides all of your hair except a tuft in the front,
          and come on down to the local skate park. With massive jumps, twists,
          and turns, this skate park will make you want to stand around most of
          the time, before trying a trick and bailing badly. It features half pipes,
          stairs, rails, chain fences to lean against, and woods close enough to
          go smoke in. If you’re in middle school and think your older brother
          might be doing drugs, or if you just like the cool kid crowd and want to
          blend in, this is the place to meet.

        <h2>Wind Turbine</h2>
        <p>
          WE ARE ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS! Phew it feels good to let everyone know.
          This lone wind turbine in Lenape Park shows neighboring boroughs that we
          care more about the earth than they do. This tri-winged, 30 foot tall,
          $80,000 monster powers one of the nearby streetlamps. Could this money
          gone towards feeding people in Africa? Yes. Would as many people know how
          great our town is? No. So stop by the wind turbine and see just how
          forcefully our town tries to impress people that don’t care about the
          earth either.
