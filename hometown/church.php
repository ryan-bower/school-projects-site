      <h1>Calvary Church</h1>
      <p class="info-sum">
        Calvary Church is the largest and most popular church in Perkasie. It holds
        many events throughout the week in addition to the normal Sunday morning
        services. There are groups for all ages, “Kidzone” for younger children,
        “Family Fusion” to mix it up with kids and their parents, “Thrive” and
        “Element” for Junior and Senior High Students, and several different groups
        for young adults. There are also Sunday services for all age groups,
        although the message is mostly intended for older audiences.

        <h2>Sunday Mass Services</h2>
        <p>
          There a three Sunday masses that are held every week. The early bird
          session is from 8:30-10:00, and is really, really early in the morning.
          We’re talking getting up before 8:00am after a Saturday night of doing
          things you’re going to repent for the next day, early. Then there’s the
          10:30-12:00 lazy bird session, which gets you hom e in time for the game
          and your Sunday afternoon beer. For the nightowls, there is also an 8:00
          pm session for those who can’t make it in the morning. There are also
          plenty of other groups to check out below if you want more, or Sunday
          mass isn’t for you.

        <h2>Kidzone and Family Fusion</h2>
        <p>
          Kidzone is for children in Kindergarten through fifth or sixth grade. In
          Kidzone we believe the bible isn’t boring, and that we should be loud and
          have a sun time. At Kidzone it’s about trusting God and being loved. Over
          at Kidzone it’s about fun and learning about Jesus. Here in Kidzone we’ll
          read the bible and learn about the stories of The Messiah. At least until
          your parents come to pick you up. At Family Fusion, you’re parents never
          leave. They can sing and dance with you! Or watch you jump around with
          more energy than they have in a week. They can listen to funky, annoying
          songs, and shouting and laughing at bad kid jokes that the speaker uses
          to keep your attention. Like jokes about farting, or thanking Jesus for
          Oreos.

        <h2>Thrive and Element</h2>
        <p>
          Thrive is designed for students in middle school, or more coolly known
          as “Junior High”. Middle School students matter to God too, even if they
          don’t feel that way. Calvary Church knows that middle school is all about
          change and finding out who you are. As long as who you are isn’t gay,
          there’s a place for you here! Many kids start to lose their faith as they
          grow older, but surrounding yourself with other Christian friends who
          support you can keep you on the straight and narrow. Once a student
          reaches High School, they graduate to Element which is basically the same
          thing, but for a slightly older crowd and has a bigger focus on NOT
          HAVING SEX. At least until you’re married. Because Jesus is always
          watching, but if he sees that wedding band, it means you’re not going to
          Hell.

        <h2>Young Adult Groups</h2>
        <p>
          These groups are tailored towards those ages 18-35, and have a range of
          different focuses. “Young Married Gatherings” meet on second Sundays from
          12:00-2:00pm in The Refinery. They meet to connect with other young
          couples at Calvary to eat lunch, receive a lesson, and brag about how
          much they’ve been doing it now that it’s okay with God. At “Living Room
          Tuesdays” young adults can come to discuss current issues they’re having
          in their life, ask questions, and learn about how the bible addresses
          problems in their life. They meet on Tuesdays, go figure, at 7:00pm next
          to Mr. B’s Coffeehouse. Finally, young adults can also meet on Sundays in
          room 301 (separate from the normal mass) for bible study, discussion, and
          extra Jesus points.
