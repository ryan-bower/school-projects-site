        <p>
          Dog Parks are not a place for young puppies younger than 6 months. The
          park can be very dangerous for young pups, and there will probably be way
          to many people there who want to pick them up and hug them. Don’t come to
          the mark trying to pick up chicks with your cute pupper, that’s what the
          park is for.
        </p>
        <p>
          For your first visit, don’t bring your dog. Feel it out yourself, see the
          grounds and sniff around a bit first. Get familiar with the area and make
          a game plan of which attractions you’ll hit first, before the lines start
          forming. Maybe try out some of the rides without your dog, so he want see
          you having so much fun and get jealous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be aware that dogs have different play styles. Some are aggro, and will
          try to jump in your face as much as possible. Others use control to stall
          out until you’re too tired to resist petting them. Others use what is
          called OTK or “Over the Top Kuteness” and will take you out in one go.
          Make sure you and your dog are ready for any of these play styles for the
          most success.
