      <h1>Pennridge School District</h1>
      <p class="info-sum">
        The Pennridge School District consists of seven Elementary schools, three
        middle schools, and Pennridge High School. The elementary schools are
        Bedminster, Deibler, Grasse, Guth, Sellersville, Seyler, and West Rockhill.
        The middle schools are Penn Central, Penn North, and Penn South. The high
        schools are Pennridge High School for general education, and Upper Bucks
        Technical School for those seeking technical jobs. Click

        <h2>Elementary Schools</h2>
        <p>
          The elementary schools are for kids in kindergarten through fifth grade,
          and are spread throughout the larger Bucks County area. The Bedminster
          Wild Cats are known for their creativity and amazing arts shows. The
          Deibler Dolphins are known for their strong special education sector,
          and the J.M. Grasse Bulldogs are known for their wrestling team. The
          Guth Gators are known for their antics, always getting into mischief.
          The Sellersville Sharks were known for their amazing principle Dr. Manker,
          who was replaced by a much more mediocre one. The Seyler Panthers are
          known for their delicious cafeteria meals, and the West Rockhill Mountain
          Lions was actually a name given to a wild pack of mountain lions over in
          West Rockhill. They are actually very dangerous, and not a school at all.

        <h2>Middle Schools</h2>
        <p>
          South middle school is south of the other two middle schools and is the
          school of choice for families who live in the southern half of the county.
          South middle school pride themselves on security, which is why they have
          a metal detector at all entrances into the school. They also hold the
          most “Code Blue” drills. Central Middle School would have been called
          “Middle Middle School” but the board that it would be too ridiculous of
          a name. It is in a Central location between South and North Middle
          Schools, and is the closest to Pennridge High School. Many families in
          the longleaf development right next to it are able to walk to school
          since the buildings are right outside of neighborhood. North Middle
          School is the furthest north in the district and is where all of the
          northerners go to public middle school. It should be noted that they
          have the highest count of students of Native American descent, as there
          is an Indian Reserve just north of the school.

        <h2>High Schools</h2>
        <p>
          Pennridge High School is where all of the middle schools dump into, to
          mix a pot of 600 or so students that only know a third of their new class.
          It is also where terrified home schooled kids go after their parents
          realize they should get a real education before being thrown into the
          real world. The school has a great food policy, a live morning show,
          iPads in many classrooms, and a serious sense of spirit. Pennridge is
          all about leading their students to success, and by success I mean
          passing standardized tests to get more funding. Pennridge has different
          levels of difficulty in class, ranging from Transitional, to Academic,
          to Honors, and Advanced Placement. These roughly translate to easy,
          medium, hard, and “college level” although most of the teachers for the
          college level courses would struggle to take their class in an actual
          university. The Bucks Technical School allows students to bus out of the
          Pennridge High School building for half a day of technical instruction,
          for those who are not college bound. They receive alternative instruction
          in technical areas so they can begin to train for professions such as
          plumber, electrician, farmer, and others.
