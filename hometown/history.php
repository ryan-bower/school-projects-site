      <h1>Town History</h1>
      <p class="info-sum">
        Perkasie has a rich history full of courage, struggle, famine, and even
        self-cannibalism. This is a brief overview of the highlights and surprising
        facts about how Perkasie came to be. We will begin with the initial sale
        of the sub section of Bucks County that later becomes the town of Perkasie.
        Then we will turn to the child massacre of 1893 and the ghosts that came
        about because of it. Finally we’ll take a look at the most recent events
        leading up to modern day Perkasie.

        <h2>Formation of Perkasie</h2>
        <p>
          The Manor of Perkasie was laid out and surveyed in 1708, and contained
          11,462 acres. This boundary set the stage for what will become a booming
          city in the coming years. In 1777, the British were in control of
          Philadelphia when a troop of 56 Dragoons visited a homestead in the
          Perkasie. They pillaged the property, burned the residents, and ate all
          they had. The savage act was not justified, and was never rectified
          leading to lost spirits that roam the property to this day.

        <h2>Railroad to Bethlehem</h2>
        <p>
          In 1853 the railroad only stretched from Fort Washington to Philadelphia,
          until was decided that they extend it to Bethlehem. That year they begin
          to build tracks starting from both ends, as sort of a race to the middle.
          Ken Bickel, supervisor of the project, ruled that the first to the center
          would be granted 100 acres of land and a daughter of his choosing. Though
          his daughters were all undeniably homely, the free land was a real
          encouragement to the teams to get to the center first and by 1858 they
          finished it.

        <h2>Samuel Hager’s Stone Building</h2>
        <p>
          Samuel Hager built a stone building at seventh and market street for the
          purpose of selling lumber, coal, and limes. Nobody really knows why those
          three items were put together, especially since he couldn’t even grow
          limes locally. But what Sam lacked in business skills, he made up for in
          architectural ability. The building was later bought by Joseph Hendricks
          in 1868 and turned into a general store. It was resold every few decades,
          but still stands today and is known as “Susy’s Lounge”, the only
          gentleman’s bar in Perkasie.

        <h2>The Child Massacre of 1893</h2>
        <p>
          One of the worst tragedies of the 19th century was the massacre where
          several able bodied children took to the streets with violence. They
          managed to kill roughly 130 people in their homes, after their demands
          were refused. They requested a giant check that be payed to “Mr. Pooper”
          for $10,000, and a legal name change for their leader from Tommy Johnson
          to Tomithus Poopus Pooper. As a reference, $10,000 converted to today’s
          money is about the same as a 32 minor plastic surgery procedures. This
          massacre was not documented in any official history books or newspaper
          articles, but rather told by my Grandpappy.

        <h2>Construction of Major Fast Food Restaurants</h2>
        <p>
          The most important developments of the time were the construction of the
          major fast food chains in the local area. It drew potential buys to the
          area, and allowed for the city to flourish. In 1934 the first McDonalds
          was erected, and 4 years later a Burger King for some reason. Then in
          1956 Rita Mascara’s water ice stand became an official business called
          “Rita Elizabeth Maria Alexandra Mascara’s Water Ice” which was later to
          shortened to just “Rita’s Water Ice”. Finally a Chipotle was planned for
          construction in 2013 and attracted even more future residence. Though the
          construction was quietly cancelled, the effect stayed.
