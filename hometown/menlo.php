      <h1>Menlo Pool</h1>
      <div class="info-sum">
        <p>
          Menlo pool was established in 1946, and served as a small community pool
          for over half of a century. In 2004 the grounds were remodeled and
          expanded, creating what is now known as the leisure pool. The lazy river,
          whirlpool, slides, and kids activity areas were added making the pool
          much more popular for summer visits.

      <!-- Competition Pool Features -->
      <div class="info-topic">
        <h2>Competition Size Pool</h2>
        <p>
          Host of many community swim meets, the competition swimming pool is the
          largest feature at Menlo pool. It boasts 8 lanes of 25-yard swimming
          perfection, as well as a “Drop Slide”, an in-water Rock Wall, and two
          diving boards seen in the images below. This pool’s depths range from 4’
          to 12’ 6” deep, with a deep end designed for competitive diving. In
          order for those under 12 to access this feature they must complete a
          swim test of two laps, and two minutes treading water.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rock wall features three routes of increasing difficulty. You can
          challenge a friend in a race to the top, before jumping off and back
          into the water!
          The drop slide is a closed-type slide, before opening up several feet
          above the pool. Make sure to hold your nose as you plummet into the
          water!
          Two competition style diving boards stand side-by-side in the
          competition pool, and allow for skilled pool goers to show off their
          moves as the jump, spin, or karate kick into the water!

      <!-- Leisure Pool Features -->
      <div class="info-topic">
        <h2>Leisure Pool</h2>
        <p>
          The pool of choice for those looking to relax, the leisure pool has a
          zero-grade, beach-like entrance that also you to walk right out into
          the water with easy access. This pool has many fun features including
          the lazy river, the whirlpool, a winding slide, and the younger kids
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lazy river is an iconic feature of the Menlo Pool, and also you
          to take a slow ride in a tube around in a lazy river of sorts.
          The whirl pool is nested inside of the lazy river, and features a
          spinning toilet bowl of water to spin in with your friends and
          enemies.
          The Winding Slide is one of the coolest features of the Menlo Pool.
          Some say top speeds of 6 mph can be reached around the final bend,
          but you’ll have to see for yourself!
          The kid’s activity pool is perfect for those young or young of heart,
          that love “splishing” and “splashing”. It has a max depth of 1’ 6”,
          perfect for school aged children, or anyone else I guess. If you want
          to go in, we won’t stop you.
          The pool for tots isn’t designed for the delicious deep-fried potato
          food, but perfect for children 0-3 years old. The shallow water is
          safe for all little ones, and the pool features friends “Tracey the
          Toad” and “Skippy the Whale”.
