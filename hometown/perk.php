        <h2>History of the Perk</h2>
        <p>
          Established in 1869 after one of the biggest dog fight rings in Perkasie
          History was broken up, The Perk is the most beloved family restaurant in
          the area. Within the first 6 months of opening up, there were nine major
          kitchen fires, three of which burned the building to the ground. Luckily
          all of the incidents happened on the Sabbath, and there were no injuries.
          This bad luck was the cause for the burger called the “Engine 26” because
          of how often the fire department was called. For the full menu, click

        <h2>The Perk Birthday Tradition</h2>
        <p>
          One of the things The Perk is known most for is their song and dance.
          Those working there always find out if one of the customers is having a
          birthday. Once they discover that a patron is, the “Perkual” (A
          combination of Perk and ‘ritual’) begins. First, the lights flicker.
          Unnoticeable at first, but more and more frequent over the course of a
          few minutes until it gets to epilepse-inducing speeds. Then, the lights
          go out, and everyone without a birthday drops to the floor (those
          physically able). If you have a birthday, it’s too late to try and get
          out of it or pretend it’s not today. Resistance is futile, and what’s
          coming is fun. Next you’ll hear a low humming coming from Don “Big”
          Dundle. He’s a large, muscular man who enters the room in a slowing,
          shimmering robe.

        <h2>The Perk Ritual Continued</h2>
        <p>
          His deep growl grows and grows in volume, and other employees or
          long-standing patrons join in. Some shout in a high register, some
          bang their hands on the walls. The volume gets to a deafening rumble,
          before everyone stops and point to the person with the birthday. Then
          that person is risen in the air, and passed around the room like they’re
          crowd surfing. Don “Big” Dundle places a crown of thorns on their head
          and says, looking into their eyes, “You have navigated another solar
          cycle, young one. Tell me, what is your spirit’s poem?” Then the
          birthday person’s eyes roll back, and they speak a strange, monotone
          tongue. They tell of a great battle raging in an invisible world
          parallel to our own. The voice tells of terrible suffering that exists
          elsewhere, for there to be relative peace here. This tongue lets the
          room know of the awesome sacrifice occurring under them, for them, in
          them. Then their eyes roll back, color returns to their face, and
          everyone laughs and continues with their meal. Chocolate cake is served,
          and will be shown as $6.99 on the bill.

        <h2>Menu Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          The perk is known for their burgers, so if you love a good patty and
          you’re passing by then you’re in luck! With so many great ones to choose,
          you can’t go wrong. The Carousel Burger features crispy homegrown bacon,
          sharp cheddar cheese, bourbon sauce, and frizzled onions. If you’re
          looking for something spicy, the Engine 26 is for you. It has Jalapenos
          piled high, a generous amount of chipotle sauce, and lettuce that isn’t
          green. The classic of course, is the Perk Burger named not after the
          restaurant, but rather Daniel Perk who attended the local high school
          and looked a lot like former President Ronald Regan. It comes with raw
          onions, American cheese, mayonnaise, and memories. You cannot go wrong
          with any of the burgers one the menu!
