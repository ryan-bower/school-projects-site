          <h2>What is Bouldering?</h2>
          <p>
            Those who haven't rock climbed much in the past usually think of getting strapped
            into a harness and climbing to the top of a vertical wall, all while having a trained
            climber belay them with a rope. However much of climbing can be done without and
            equipment, other than a mat and a pair of climbing shoes. The Red Barn offers
            bouldering, which involves climbing routes marked with different colored tape. Below
            is a video about the classes offered, and what climbing is like.

            When climbing, you follow "routes" that have a start and finished hold, both marked
            with a "V" in tape. In order to complete a route you must hold onto the start hold
            and only use the rocks marked with the same color tape to get to the finish. At the
            Red Barn the difficulty of the route is written on the tape of the start hold telling
            you the recommended climbing level needed to complete it; beginner, intermediate,
            advanced or expert.

          <h2>The Facility</h2>
          <p>
            The Red Barn features a large open area on the first floor with top out walls and
            two high walls. The stairs lead to the basement cave, which features most of the
            climbing surfaces in the building. There are a range of different angles and overhangs
            that allow for a ton of different moves and route possibilities. Every Sunday, the
            management take down all of the routes on one of the walls and replaces them with new
            problems, keeping the climbing fresh no matter how often you come.

            The indoor climbing facility also offers heat lamps to keep the building warm in
            the winter, and the large volume of climbers contribute their body heat as well.
            There is no indoor plumbing or heat/ac units, but there is a port-o-john just outside
            and plenty of fans keeping the temperature surprisingly well regulated.

          <h2>History of the Barn</h2>
          <p>
            RIT's Red Barn is the oldest building on campus. Built in 1908, the Barn belonged to local
            farmers until RIT purchased the land on which it sat during our transition to the Henrietta campus
            in 1968. Initially, the Barn's intended use was as a night spot for dances, banquets, concerts and other parties.
            During the planning phase, which lasted from early spring of 1968 to that same fall, the barn
            was nicknamed the "Beer Barn." That October, the project of converting the barn into a student
            activities building was dropped due to cost, in favor of building a student area on what were
            then picnic grounds.

          <p>
            Following the halt in conversion plans, Facilities Management Services used the Red Barn to
            store their equipment until the building was cleaned out to make room for an outdoors adventure
            program in1982, which included rock climbing. It was only in 2005 that the Red Barn Climbing
            Gym, as we know it today, was established.
