          <h2>Original Elements Created from Scratch</h2>
          <p>
            I created the top banner that is displayed on all of the pages by taking a photo from the
            facebook page and adding a semi-transparent box and text. It creates consistancy between
            pages, and allows for the user to clearly see what the Red Barn is about.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also designed the navigational buttons to make divs work as links. Though the icons are not mine,
            the buttons have a darkening hover effect to give a button feel, while maintaing a flat bar
            appearance when you are not hovering. I recognize that they are very large, but I feel that it
            creates an easy to use site.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
          <h2>Embedded Media Used</h2>
          <p>
            I used an embedded YouTube video on my about page, that was made by RIT. It gives information
            about bouldering, as well as classes taught in the barn.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also embedded a google map of the Red Barn's location. It makes it easier for the user to see where
            it is located in relation to other RIT campus buildings, and even allows the user to click a link and
            enter their address to get directions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
          <h2>CSS Rollover Effect</h2>
          <p>
            The images on the about page have a rollover effect that change the box shadow. If you then click on
            the image, it will open the raw image in a new tab. I did this for the about page, because the pictures
            are of particular interest. They show information about the Red Barn's building and history.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also used a rollover effect on the navigational button divs as mentioned before. It changes their
            color, and gives it a button-feel animation.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
          <h2>Best Parts of the Site</h2>
          <p>
            One of my favorite elements is the navigation. It gives a uniquely simple and clean alternitive to the
            type of buttons or links you normally see as a navigation. I feel that the icons chosen are consistant
            with each other, and added to the mood of the layout.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another part of the site that I feel is well done is my home page. Despite being the only page without a
            large header at the top telling you what it is, it feels like a landing page to a professional site. The
            news feed on the right gives easy access to the latest happenings at the barn, and the pictures show off
            some of the regular climbers.
          </p>
          <p>
            I really feel I did a good job with the layout of the price and hours pages, and a great job making the code
            reusable. I didn't need to do any extra styling for the prices page, because it has the exact same layout as
            hours with different content.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
          <h2>Places for Improvement</h2>
          <p>
            I feel that I could definitely improve the scalablility for different sized screens. Though I attempted to use
            queries for screens smaller than 1366px, I did not have time to implement a smaller version for mobile. The site
            is viewable and the buttons are big enough, but the navigational layout is not optimized for smaller screens.
            I would improve the navigation bar and layout of different size screens.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another place in need of a bit of improvement is my maps page. The layout clashes a bit with the rest of the
            site, and looks a bit awkward. Though I am proud to be re-using most of the code from other pages, I hard-coded
            a bit and it could have turned out better.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="table">
          <h2>Extra Work</h2>
          <p>
            Embeding the google map to show the correct location and have a link to directions, I feel, went beyond the
            requirements. It adds a really nice touch, to not only provide the address and basic directions, but also allow
            the user to easily search directions using their own address.
          </p>
          <p>
            The navigation uses several html and styling techniques to get the correct look. I filled the entire navigation
            bar witha a solid color, then added a hover effect to the individual nav elements (each spanning 1/5 of the bar)
            that changes its background color over top. I also ensured that the the user could not highlight the text, and that
            it didn't change the cursor to the selector cursor (which is what is does by default). This leads to a clean,
            believable button using only css.
