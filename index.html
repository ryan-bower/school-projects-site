        </a>
        <p>
          Using stark contrast of popping colors between sections that run the
          full length of the screen, I’ve created a clean-looking site that
          scales beautifully and looks great in browsers and mobile devices.
          Octuv Music is an app idea that a group of students and I developed,
          making wireframes for mobile pages and eventual mock-up screenshots
          of what the finish app would look like. I also shot and edited a
          commercial that explains the use of our app idea which was very fun
          to make. The outcome was sleek, uncluttered, and provided the
          appropriate “download” links and social media plugs.

        <p>
          With a focus on easy navigation using bright images to navigate
          users through the pages, my Hometown website shows off fancy JavaScript
          dropdowns and well styled buttons. The purpose of the site is to
          provide easy-to-find information about the town I grew up in, and is
          intended for users of any age. All content, banners, and graphics
          were designed and made by myself.

          <h2>Red Barn Climbing</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          Intending to make a proper website for the Red Barn climbing facility
          at R.I.T., I designed and implemented a colorful page with large
          navigational icons to allow easy access to all of the information on
          the site. This project exercised making content for an actual company,
          and is in the process of being used for the official Red Barn Climbing
          web site.

          <h2>Choose-Your-Own Adventure</h2>
        </a>
        <p>
          Though the styling on this site is lack luster, this choose-your-own
          adventure site exhibits advance use of JavaScript to read a JSON file
          and dynamically create elements on the page. It demonstrates understanding
          of the DOM and has reusable functions that make the various html elements
          necessary to create the site. Changing choices in the story will delete
          child elements and replace them with new information based on these story
          decisions. It showcases my ability to use JavaScript functions to read
          files and create web elements.
